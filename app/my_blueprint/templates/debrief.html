                In this study, you were asked to complete a task that required you to view different data visualizations and detect areas or data points that are emphasized.
                The data used in the scatter plots does not have any particular meaning (all dot positions on the visualizations were randomly assigned).
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this research is to add to the understanding of visual emphasis, leading to more effective visualization techniques.

            </p>

            <strong> Thanks again for your participation.</strong>
